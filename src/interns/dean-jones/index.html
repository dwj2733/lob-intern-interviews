        <p>
            I want to be a software engineer because I love programming, and because I enjoy creating things that other people can use and enjoy. I'd like to create software that 
            makes people's life easier, like a job application website or an online shopping interface. During my internship, I would like to test my problem solving skills in the real 
            world, instead of through a personal project or in a classroom setting. An internship would also provide the opportunity to learn from new people as well as get more
            practice working with people that have different coding backgrounds. I have a strong coding base, am capable of learning new things quickly, and love working as part of
            a team.
